/**
 * Where the company is: a photograph of the city, the globe behind it, and the
 * one figure on this page that can be checked against something.
 *
 * The first reference film rings its globe with figures — 50 locations, 40 of
 * something else. **We have no figures like that and will not invent them**, so
 * the label carries the city's actual coordinates and the section says where
 * the company is rather than how much of it there is. That is not a compromise:
 * the film's numbers are doing a typographic job as much as an informational
 * one — a mono figure with a hairline running off it — and a real coordinate
 * does that job and is true.
 *
 * **The photograph is new and it is a placeholder.** The second film leans on
 * real photography throughout, and this page had none; a page about a company
 * in Kathmandu with no picture of anywhere is colder than it needs to be. It is
 * a picture of the city rather than of an office, because a stock photograph of
 * an office reads as a picture of this office, and that is a claim. See
 * `lib/home/place.ts`.
 *
 * It is tilted, and it drifts against the scroll. Both are the film's treatment
 * of a photograph — it never sets one square to the grid — and both cost one
 * property each. Under the mouse it stretches like an elastic sheet
 * (`ElasticPhoto`), which costs nothing until someone hovers it.
