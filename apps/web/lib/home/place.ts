/**
 * The photograph in the "where we are" section.
 *
 * A real picture of the city, from Unsplash, standing in until the company has
 * photographs of its own. `images.unsplash.com` is already the one non-bucket
 * host `next/image` is allowed to optimise from — see
 * `lib/images/trusted-hosts.ts` — so this needs no config change and no
 * download.
 *
 * It carries no caption: the section already names the city beside its
 * coordinates. A stock photograph of an office with people in it would read as
 * a picture of this company's office and this company's staff, which is a
 * claim, and claims about the business wait for the founder. A picture of
 * Kathmandu is a picture of Kathmandu.
 *
 * Replace `src` with an R2 URL when the real photograph exists; nothing else
 * here changes.
