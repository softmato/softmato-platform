/**
 * Presigned PUT URLs, so an upload goes browser → R2 and never through us.
 *
 * The file itself is the reason. A serverless function on Vercel rejects a
 * request body over 4.5 MB before our handler runs, which is *below* the 5 MB
 * the product allows — so routing bytes through the server made the last
 * 0.5 MB of the documented range impossible to upload. Signing a URL and
 * stepping out of the way removes the ceiling entirely, and stops paying to
 * move every megabyte twice.
 *
 * What the signature pins down:
 *
 * - **The key.** The caller never chooses where its file lands; the server
 *   built the key and signed exactly that one.
 * - **`Content-Type`.** R2 stores and later *serves* this value, so it is the
 *   one header that must not be left free. It is signed, which means R2 will
 *   reject a PUT that sends anything else, and it is chosen from a
 *   six-entry allowlist (four images, two videos) server-side. That is what keeps the public bucket
 *   from ever serving a caller-supplied `text/html`.
 * - **A short life.** Two minutes is enough to start an upload and useless to
 *   anyone who finds the URL later.
 *
 * What it deliberately does *not* pin down is the bytes. Nothing signed can
 * make a browser send an actual PNG, so the magic-byte rule that
 * docs/ENVIRONMENT.md §3 requires cannot live here — it moves to the confirm
 * step, which reads the first bytes back out of the bucket before the URL is
 * ever handed to the CMS. See `app/api/admin/upload/confirm/route.ts`.
